This project is a multi-threaded brute-forcing tool developed for Geph.io. Using asynchronous requests and concurrent threads, it efficiently checks a list of user credentials to determine account validity and subscription type (free or premium). The UI is implemented with a simple form that provides live feedback on the brute-forcing process, displaying the count of valid, free, and invalid accounts.
